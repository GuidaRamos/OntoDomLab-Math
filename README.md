# OntoDomLab-Math
OntoDomLab-Math is a domain label ontology focused on MATHEMATICS and its subdomains. It has been developed within the project [MORDigital – Digitisation of Diccionario da Lingua Portugueza by António de Morais Silva (PTDC/LLT-LIN/6841/2020)](https://mordigital.fcsh.unl.pt/en/about/). It aims to provide a solid conceptual basis to facilitate interoperability with TEI Lex-0 and to contribute to i) consistency in the assignment of domain labels and ii) efficiency in information retrieval.

OntoDomLab-Math is being developed in OWL.
