# OntoDomLab-Math
OntoDomLab-Math is an ontology of domain labels focused on MATHEMATICS and corresponding sub-domains. It has been developed at NOVA CLUNL within the framework of the project [MORDigital – Digitisation of Diccionario da Lingua Portugueza by António de Morais Silva (PTDC/LLT-LIN/6841/2020)](https://mordigital.fcsh.unl.pt/en/about/). Its purpose is to provide a solid conceptual foundation that facilitates interoperability with TEI Lex-0, as well as improve: 
i) the consistency of domain labelling assignment and ii) the efficiency in what concerns information retrieval.

OntoDomLab-Math is being developed in OWL.
